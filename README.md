# Alpha version of the micro:bit Python editor

_This project is an alpha version of the next major version of the editor. The currently supported micro:bit Python editor is available at https://python.microbit.org/ and its source code can be found in GitHub at https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor._

For more background about how this editor relates to the original Python Editor project, see [this explanation](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor/issues/391).

This project is a web-based code editor that targets the [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) version of the [Python programming language](http://python.org/).

Code written with this editor is expected to run on the [BBC micro:bit device](https://microbit.org).

## Developing the editor

The editor is written in TypeScript using React. We use the Chakra UI component library and [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/) editor component.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

To learn TypeScript, check out the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

To learn more about Chakra UI check out the [component library documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started).

CodeMirror 6 has [great documentation](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/). The [system guide](https://codemirror.net/6/docs/guide/) is a particularly useful overview of the key concepts.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

If you use Visual Studio Code you might find the devcontainer included in this repository a useful option to get an automatically configured development environment. [Find out more about containers and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## Deployments

The editor is deployed by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/microbit-foundation/python-editor-next).

The `main` branch is deployed to https://stage-python-editor-next.microbit.org/ on each commit.

Other branches (e.g. for PRs) are deployed to https://review-python-editor-next.microbit.org/{branch}. Special characters in the branch name are replaced by hyphens.

For custom deployments, note that the educational content in the sidebar is currently sourced live from our CMS. For non-localhost deploys this will require CORS configuration on our end. Please open an issue to discuss this.

## Building and running the editor

1. Ensure you have a working Node.js environment. We recommend using the LTS version of Node and NPM 8+.
2. Checkout this repository.
3. Install the dependencies via `npm install`.
4. Choose from the NPM scripts documented below.

If you're using VSCode, it is recomended you do the following to complete steps 1-3:

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and get the Remote-Containers extention for VSCode.
- If you have git installed and are logged into GitHub in VSCode (see the Source Control Tab), then you can clone the repo into a Container: Hit Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette, run "Clone Repository in Container Volume", choose GitHub and select this repo.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

If you have a connected micro:bit device, then setting the environment variable `TEST_MODE_DEVICE=1` will enable additional tests that will connect to your micro:bit. The tests will overwrite programs and data on the micro:bit.

### `npm run test:e2e`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode running the end to end tests.

These are excluded from the normal test run.

The tests expect the app to already be running on http://localhost:3000, for example via `npm start`.

We use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and the helpers provided by [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/pptr-testing-library/intro/).

The CI tests run these end-to-end tests against a production build.

### `npm run test:all --testPathPattern toolkit`

An example of how to use jest options to filter to a specific subset of the tests (e2e or unit).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Feature flags

The editor supports a simple runtime feature flag system to:

- allow work-in-progress features to be integrated before they're ready for general use
- allow scenarios to be set up for user testing
- enable debug features

This system may change without notice. Flags are regularly added and removed.

The current set of flags are documented in [the source](./src/flags.ts).

Flags may be specified via the query string with repeated `flag` parameters,
for example, http://localhost:3000/?flag=oneFlag&flag=anotherFlag

By default, all flags are enabled for local development and branches builds.
They can be disabled with the special flag `none`.

## Translations

We use react-intl from [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/) to manage strings for translation.

Add strings to `lang/en.json` and run `npm run i18n:compile` to update the strings used by the app.

There is a French translation of the main user interface text and the "Explore" tab content.
The Reference tab and code error messages shown in the editor are not currently translated.
